You stare at the non-discript grey cylinder that seems left over from early stages of development.

* Hello? -> Talk
+ A sane person does not talk to grey cylinders -> END

=== Talk ===
Nothing happens. No response. Which is quite reasonable after all.
* Hello! -> Grunt
* Walk away with your world views intact -> END

=== Grunt ===
Unexpectedly, there's a low guttural sound that builds and builds until it seems to vibrate the entire cylinder. And then it stops.
-> END
